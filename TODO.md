# Pirate Den: to do

Fixes, quality-of-life and feel changes the user has asked for. These are agreed: just do them.
New puzzles, new features and the user's unrefined ideas go in [IDEAS.md](IDEAS.md) instead.
When one's done, put its rule in [RULES.md](RULES.md) and delete it from here. Not published with
the site (`.assetsignore` skips `*.md`).

## Asked for

- **Land in the public den by default.** The user asked where the public lobby went (it was
  talked about but never built). The den you land in should be a public one anyone can drop into,
  with no cap on numbers. Private crews with a four-letter code stay alongside it. To work out:
  - **No cap:** the crew room is limited to four at present (`MAX_CREW` in `worker/crew.js`), and
    the first pirate's browser runs the raiders for everyone. With many pirates, that browser's
    upload and the size of each message grow, so the snapshots would need trimming. Pirates far
    away could be sent less often.
  - **Raiders scale with the crew** (half again per extra pirate), so a big drop-in crowd needs a
    sensible ceiling on wave size, or a different scaling.
  - **Drop-in, drop-out:** someone arriving mid-wave just appears and starts mending. Nobody's
    progress depends on who's there, so a pirate leaving never spoils it for the rest.
  - **Solo stays possible:** keep a way to play alone (a "Play alone" button).
  - **Moderation:** pirate names are letters only already, but an open room may want a way to hide
    a pirate who's being a nuisance.

- **No puzzle mode at the stairs (8 Nov):** the stairs frame has no "snap to puzzle" view like the
  front wall's, where the camera goes straight on and the keys move the piece. (Same question as
  "the second stage" below: the frames want it too.)
## Needs a playtest to pin down

- **Turning a piece close to the wall feels off.** The user can't yet say how (which way it
  turns? where the ghost jumps to?). The snapping changes of 7 Nov may have helped, and since 8 Nov
  the whole-wall puzzle mode (arrows move the piece by screen direction); ask again.
- **Puzzle mode at the wall (8 Nov).** The user likes the zoom and the control, but hasn't tried
  the keys yet (WASD moves the piece, arrows jump hole to hole, since 8 Nov). Still to ask: should
  it come on by itself when you walk up with a piece; the same view for the rampart and house
  frames ("the second stage")?
- **Wider walk frames (8 Nov), not yet tried by the user.** Three full rows and a ragged fourth
  (9 pieces a stretch, was about 7). Could go a row deeper if it's still too slim: the walk then
  overhangs the den further, and starts to hide the top of the wall in the whole-wall view.
- **Layers behind (8 Nov), not yet tried by the user.** A layer is now the hole's shape again,
  filled piece by piece in a timber surround, and a full one is as strong as a Masterpiece and pays
  the same. Watch for: holes three layers deep being too strong, or the pay too generous; the
  surround looking right (only a square wide round each hole: the user may have meant a whole timber
  lining between the holes, once every hole's first layer is done).
- **Wood a piece at a time, and roomier raid holes (8 Nov), not yet tried by the user.** Watch
  for: refilling a knocked-out piece being too easy a way to hold a hole forever, and cannon
  breaches feeling too big now.
- **Holding the wall.** The cannon now aims before it fires, breaches fill with rubble, and
  turning raiders away pays (RULES.md: "Keeping them out must be possible"). Since 7 Nov raiders
  also need a gap they can walk through and arrive winded after hacking one (RULES.md: "Raiders
  walk in", "Getting through costs them"), and a hole giving way dazes the raiders at it and
  chokes the gap with rubble (RULES.md: "A wall giving way hits the ones hacking at it"). The user
  has tried the gaps but not yet the dazing. Watch for: once one gap is opened, every raider
  nearby pours through it, and a single piece in it only holds two or three of them off for a few
  seconds. If it still feels hopeless or too easy, see "Holding the wall" in IDEAS.md.

## Spotted along the way (not asked for)

- **The camera indoors:** walk into the shack and its near wall hides you. Fade it out then.
- **Your den's preview** shows your flag on every tab. The Shack tab could show the shack itself
  (painted as you choose), and the Den tab the landscape.
- **Wave sizes for a crew** may need retuning after the cannon change; only solo was tested.
- **Not checked yet:** the look and den messages between two real crewmates (only tried solo),
  and the shack on a narrow den (the left-hand crate could crowd its floor frames).
