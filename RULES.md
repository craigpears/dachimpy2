# Rules and design notes

The working rulebook for the primer. When a playtest corrects something, write it down here
so it isn't lost. Two kinds of entry: facts about the real puzzle, and design rules from feedback.

## The real puzzle

- Pieces are the twelve pentominoes plus a putty bucket. Draw weights (from YPPedia):
  P 22, F 14, Y 14, N 8, L 8, T 7, W 4, U 4, V 4, Z 4, X 3, I 2, putty 1 (95 in all).
- **The toolbox holds three pieces.** You play any one of them and a fresh piece tops it up.
- A Masterpiece is a hole filled exactly, with no overlap, before it waits too long.
- Long-grain pieces (I, L, N, Y) score the Grain bonus only when lying along the hole.
- Several holes are open at once. A drawn piece that doesn't suit one hole goes into another.
- Hawkings' advice (YPPedia *Carpentry tutorial*): put the rare, awkward pieces in the odd
  corners while the hole is big; keep the flexible pieces (P above all) for the finish;
  square the hole off and work from the outside in; learn the named two-piece holes
  (Top-Notch, Dogleg, Dome, Middle-Notch, Animal, Offset, Lazy Animal, The Ship, The Rectangle).

## Design rules from playtests

- **It's a game, not a tutorial.** Short, quick-fire, with a journey and a daily puzzle.
- **Words over percentages.** Don't fill the screen with numbers. Grades, meters and rarity
  words are fine. When rarity is shown, also say how often a piece turns up as "about 1 in X"
  pieces. No decimals or percentages in the main play. **Exception:** *Which gap?* is about
  the actual sums, so it shows a percentage on each gap and the full working ("97% × 37% = 36%")
  in a fold-out panel.
- **Every choice must be a real choice.** Never show a single option. If one piece has only
  one sensible spot, offer two pieces to pick from instead.
- **There must be a right answer.** No two options may finish about as often (they must differ by
  at least a tenth and a fifth), or "the green one was stronger" splits hairs. When every move
  really is as good (often because you hold the closing piece), both show green and the feedback
  says either was right.
- **No betting on the voyage.** The bet on the last draw was dropped there; betting lives at the
  harbour table. The voyage is for earning.
- **Options must be plausible.** No obviously bad moves: every option hugs the edge and strands
  no squares. They should differ in what they set up ("leaves a Dogleg", "keeps it square").
- **Feedback must stay on screen long enough to read** before the next step rolls on.
- **The board shakes** on a bad move or a missed draw.
- **Don't say "patching"**: that's a different puzzle. Use "puzzling" or carpentry words.
- **Betting is about the three draws**, not the rarity label. Ask "you get three draws, will it
  turn up?" Betting across several holes at once is more fun than one hole at a time.
- **The trail builds up the toolbox**: one piece at the first ports, two at Tarpot Reef,
  three (the real puzzle) at Kraken's Maw and in Hole of the Day.
- **One purse for the whole site.** Earn doubloons from Masterpieces (voyage, Hole of the Day)
  and right answers; spend them on bets. Every bet is priced against the player (about an 8%
  edge), and the house refuses bets that are too likely. Gambling alone should slowly lose.
- **In-play betting is the fun bit** (like blackjack): pieces come one at a time, prices move,
  and you can add bets between pieces. Holes that don't get finished are "bodged".
- **Which pair fits?** is exactly right for teaching two-piece finishes; build more games in that style.
  Three big buttons above the puzzle (not a small slider) set how many pieces finish the hole (2 to 4; five-piece holes are too slow to build
  and have too many answers). Harder holes must feel properly rewarded, so the pay climbs steeply:
  2 pieces pay 1, 3 pieces 4, 4 pieces 10. **Guessing must not pay:** a wrong answer costs as
  much as a right one pays (in *Which gap?* anything worse than a close second costs 2).
- **Place your bets: no "A before B".** A piece only fills one hole, but the order mustn't feel
  arbitrary. If two holes need the same piece, it goes to the one with more of your money on it,
  and the prices are worked out with that rule. Stakes leave the purse as you place them, and
  the purse is shown on the page, not just in the corner.
- **Every hole on the betting table shows its odds**, two-piece holes too: how often a starting
  piece turns up ("about 1 in 2 pieces") and how often it gets finished from the pieces left.
- **Earn, then face off.** The landing page leads with two steps: earn doubloons (the puzzles,
  best payers first, with what each pays), then bet them against other pirates at the harbour
  table. The menu groups them the same way ("Earn doubloons", "Bet them"). When your purse is
  empty at the table, a clear box sends you to the puzzles.
- **Every game feeds the one purse**, and its page shows your purse and what it pays.
  *Which gap?* pays 2 for the best gap and 1 for a close second.
- **No looping animations.** The bobbing ship and spinning ring on the map hurt to watch. Movement
  should be a short reaction to something you did (a piece dropping in, a shake, a glow).
- **Keep text readable.** Nothing that matters (stakes, returns, odds) in tiny hint text.
- **Say why a move is risky in plain odds.** Every option shows "Finishes about N times in 10"
  (three draws for each piece still needed), and the grades come from that same number.
- **Odds as bookmaker's prices** ("3 to 1", "evens"), worked out from the real chance, not
  from the rarity label.
- **Make it sociable.** Pick a pirate name (letters only, no sign-up) and your purse goes on a
  leaderboard beside the game. The purse lives in the browser, so the board is an honour system
  with guard rails (no huge jumps in one go). Only ever show pirate names, never real ones.
- **Competitive play is capped.** Head-to-head games give everyone the same stake, so a big purse
  buys no edge. If you run out, you earn your way back in with the quick puzzles first.
- **The harbour table is player against player.** One shared round every 45 seconds: 20 seconds
  to bet, then five pieces for everyone. No bookie: all stakes go in one pot. If more than one
  hole gets finished, the rarest one with money on it wins. **The winners share the whole pot by
  stake**, like a horse-racing tote: put 10 of the 40 on the winning hole and you get a quarter.
  Every other bet is lost, so spreading money over every hole has a real cost, and a hole few
  pirates back pays big. Each hole shows its live tote price ("pays 3 to 1"). (Tried and dropped:
  poker-style side pots, where you could only win your own stake from each pirate. Nobody could
  follow the split, and losing bets often came straight back, so covering every hole was free.)
  If nobody backed a finished hole, the whole pot rolls over into the next round's pot. Each hole is labelled Rarest … Likeliest. House pirates
  (Cap'n Bones, One-Eyed Peg, Barnacle Bill) bet every round so there's always a pot. Stakes are
  capped at 20 a round, bets are final, and the pieces stay secret on the server until betting
  closes. The solo table against the bookie stays as *Practice bets*.
- **Who's at the table must be obvious.** A prominent panel beside the holes (above them on narrow
  screens) lists every pirate at the table, house pirates marked, with what each has on which hole,
  and after the round who won and who lost. Each hole also lists its backers by name.
- **The table fits on one screen.** All four holes in one row, a short intro with the pot rules
  folded away, and the page brings the pile into view as the pieces turn over. Betting is one big
  button per hole. **The leaderboard stays visible at the table**; the crew goes beside the holes
  only when there's room, otherwise in a strip above them.
- **Say plainly what you can win.** Each hole shows its price and what you'd win or lose if it
  wins, counting your other bets. After the round, the split panel lists each winner's stake on the
  hole and their share of the pot.
- **Stake first, then holes.** The stake is picked separately (5, 10, 15 or 20, as chips above the
  holes), then each hole's button places it. Betting on several holes at once stays: it's fun.
  (Tried and dropped: one hole per round.) The holes you've backed are highlighted.
- **Show how the split worked, as a picture.** After each round a "How the pot was split" panel
  lists every stake that went in (the winning hole's highlighted), then shows the pot as one bar
  that breaks into each winner's share, labelled with name, fraction ("1/2") and doubloons.
- **Watching is free, playing needs a name.** Anyone can watch the table; a clear "You're only
  watching" box asks for a pirate name before you can bet.
- Ideas to build next: a daily head-to-head on Hole of the Day (same pieces for everyone, a board
  of who got the Masterpiece); and *carpentry poker*: two pieces in your hand,
  the holes on the table, then shared pieces dealt like a flop, turn and river, with betting
  between each; and *crew carpentry*: a co-op Hole of the Day where the crew take turns round a
  circle, each picking one of the dealt pieces, and the whole crew shares the grade and the pay.
- Dropped ideas: *Commit or wait* (not interesting).

## Pirate Den (3D prototype, `den.html`)

Unlisted for now: reachable only by its URL until the user says to put it in the nav.

- **A pirate mends a den wall.** Pieces sit on three crates (the toolbox); you carry them over and
  fit them into holes in a stone wall. Same pieces, weights and Masterpiece rule as the main game.
- **You can never get stuck.** Like real carpentry, a piece may be nailed over the stone around a
  hole ("boarded over"). That always closes the hole, but it's a botch: weak and pays little. A hole
  filled exactly is a Masterpiece: strong, and pays well.
- **Masterpieces make the wall strong.** Raiders hack at mended holes: a boarded hole falls fast, a
  Masterpiece holds. Only a completely empty hole lets raiders straight in; any wood at all (even
  one piece in an unfinished hole) has to be hacked through with swords first. No magic jumping
  through a hole that has wood in it. A thief whose way out has been mended hacks out from inside.
- **Throw pieces at raiders, don't bonk them.** A plain bonk was underwhelming. The carried piece
  is the weapon: R (or Space, when there's nowhere to fit it) hurls it at the nearest raider in the
  den, who goes flying. It costs the piece.
- **You must see what's happening in the den.** Raiders inside get a ⚔ marker, pinned to the edge
  of the screen when they're out of view (gold when carrying loot). The view widens on narrow screens.
- **Give enough time to build.** A piece takes about ten seconds to fetch and fit, so the first wave
  waits 75 seconds and starts small.
- **The den has a gate** and raiders attack from the far side of the wall, with swords and (from
  wave 2) a cannon that blasts fresh holes. Keep repairing.
- **You must be able to see the raiders.** Behind the wall they show as red silhouettes through
  the stone; labels over each hole show its strength and who's attacking it.
